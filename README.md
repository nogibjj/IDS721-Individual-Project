Project 3

Cloud-based Big Data Systems Project

Use a major Big Data system to perform a Data Engineering related task
Example systems could be: (AWS Athena, AWS Spark/EMR, AWS Sagemaker, Databricks, Snowflake)

1. get data from UCI Machine Learning Repository
2. the SageMaker preferred a Jupyter Notebook-style launcher which only support Python or R
3. use AWS Sagemaker to train a model with Jupyter Notebook, sagemaker.ipynb, in Python for training and visualization, using basic supervised learning methods of KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM to a data set of iris flowers.
4. Display the results of the model training and evaluation in a Jupyter notebook in my local machine in faster speed.
5. Please look into the sagemaker.ipynb for more details.
